*Bike Share Analysis*

In this project, we learned how to wrangle data, compute descriptive statistics, and to perform basic exploratory visualizations.

Skills demonstrated:
- Code python functions to transform unstructured CSV files into structured lists;
- Condense and further tidy by isolating common fields, also using python;
- Compute descriptive statistics such as trip counts and average trip length in python;
- Use python's `matplotlib` library to create visualizations such as histograms and bar charts illustrating trip distributions across time and geographical dimensions.
